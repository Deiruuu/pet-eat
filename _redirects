# Rule for SPA client-side routing (for pet details pages)
/pet/* /index.html 200

# Fallback for all other paths (ensures static assets are found, or route to index.html for other SPA routes)
# This rule tells Netlify to try to find a file at the requested path.
# If it can't find a file (e.g., for /script.js if script.js exists), it serves it directly.
# If it can't find a file (e.g., for /some-other-spa-route), it serves index.html.
