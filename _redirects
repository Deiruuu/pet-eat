# This rule tells Netlify:
# 1. First, try to find a static file at the requested path (e.g., /script.js, /style.css).
#    If found, serve it directly.
# 2. If no static file is found (e.g., for /pet/abc123 or /some-other-app-route),
#    then serve the index.html file with a 200 OK status.
# This ensures client-side routing works for all non-static paths.
